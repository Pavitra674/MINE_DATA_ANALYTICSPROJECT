My work aims to develop a multivariate regression model that can accurately predict coal 
production in the United States based on publicly available production data. The model 
predicts coal production based on parameters “Average Employees”, Labor Hours”, and “Mine 
Type”. The model will help find out the factors that have the greatest impact on coal production 
levels and enable us to understand better the dynamics of the coal mining industry in the 
United States. 

The purpose of this report is to develop a multivariate regression model that 
predicts coal production based on certain parameters. The model will examine the impact of 
three key variables on coal production: Average Employees, Labor Hours, and Mine Type. 
By understanding the influence of these factors on coal production, policymakers, and 
industry stakeholders can develop strategies to ensure the sustainability and stability of the 
industry and to support economic growth in coal mining regions. The results of this study will 
provide valuable deep insights into the dynamics of the coal mining industry in the United 
States and increase coal production through informed policies and strategies.

My work can have important implications for the coal mining industry in the United States. By 
understanding the factors that influence coal production, policymakers can formulate 
strategies to ensure the sustainability of the industry. For example, increasing the number of 
employees in a mine could lead to increased coal production.
